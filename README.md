# data-set-acquisition
Acquire, clean, and plot datasets from a variety of Canadian open data in both R and Python.  All tasks are "software bilingual".


This repo holds the raw quarto files.  See: https://people.math.carleton.ca/~davecampbell/datasets/ for html rendered versions of these files.


## Rendering instructions

To render these in **quarto**, in the terminal run:

- quarto render

The rendering will search out all .qmd files in all directories downstream.  The html is rendered and produces relative links so that the output is easily uploaded.

or to view a preview of the webpage run:

-  quarto preview
  
the webpage will be built in a (new) folder "_site"
