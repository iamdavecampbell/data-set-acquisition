# data-set-acquisition
Acquire and clean datasets from Canadian open data using R and Python.  

See: https://people.math.carleton.ca/~davecampbell/datasets/ for html rendered versions of these files, complete with code and output.

Both languages are used throughout.  The .qmd files contain both R and Python code sets.

Each page can be rendered into html as is, except that the census page pulls a few png files that will need to be placed into an _images_ folder.
